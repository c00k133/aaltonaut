        Communication is an important aspect in everyday life, extending itself to all fields imaginable.
        Personally I always set communication to a high priority; conveying my own thoughts and feelings are extremely important to me &mdash; I want to be understood.
        When I phase a problem &mdash; professionally or personally &mdash; I always have a clear structure in mind for formatting my message.
        These structures have helped me countless times, and they are appreciated by my peers:

    +add-quote('Excellent explanation and progress on the matter!')
    +add-quote('Thank you for painting the picture so clearly!')

        Communication is a two-way channel, something that I never try to forget.
        Personally I would call myself a good listener, I give my full attention to others.

        I have also worked as a class assistant for a couple of courses at Aalto University.
        The classes were Programming 2 and Data Structures and Algorithms.
        The former course was an extended course in programming, including topics such as:

    ul.is-size-6-touch.is-size-4-desktop
        li functional programming
        li algorithmic design and analysis
        li performance measures of computer programs in practice
        li concepts of recursion

        The latter course is reverred as one the most difficult courses in the Computer Science Bachelor's program at Aalto University.
        The course covered topics regarding algorithmic and data structure design, an essential course for any Computer Science student.

        I assisted both courses exactly a year after taking them myself.
        The courses were of sizes around #[em 300] students.
        My tasks included assisting in exercises during lessons and reviewing submission after them.
        Here my communication skills were put to the test, explaining logic intuitively to someone with less experience is a difficult task.
        However, I often got great feedback from both students and faculty members, where they often mentioned my accomplishment at explaining the task at hand.
