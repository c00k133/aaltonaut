        Teamwork is essential to all people oriented projects, both within product development and my own field of study, software engineering.
        When committing to a new group project I always try to initiate managerial tasks, such as suggesting communication channels, meeting times, and double-checking what has to be done.
        I have noticed that many team members appreciate this approach, where some received feedback has been the following:

    +add-quote('You always have the meta-tasks controlled.')
    +add-quote('I feel like you do some of the most work, you do a lot of management.')

        The groups I have joined have also always succeeded well.
        In total I have participated in #[em 8] group projects, varying in size &mdash; from 3 up to 8 &mdash; and project length &mdash; from a couple of months up to a year.

        One recent project in which I received great feedback on exactly the "meta-tasks" &mdash; mentioned in the first quote &mdash; took place during the Fall of 2018.
        Our team had been tasked with creating a product including sensors, system architecture, and terrain resistant packaging used in measuring seismic activity by Chilean researchers.
        I felt that with my background and field of study I would not be much help to the other team members, after all code does not really help when you are supposed to do signal processing on a hardware level.
        Although this was my feeling throughout the course, I wanted to be of assistance to my team members, who I soon also called friends.
        I always wrote down important notes from lectures, and ensured that deadlines were known to all.
        In the end I was praised by my team for keeping up a coherent schedule and informing everyone of what was needed.
        I did not realize that I had facilitated work for everyone by allowing team members to concentrate on specialized areas, but in the end that is exactly what I did.
